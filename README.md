# StellarisModCreatorTool
This is a simple tool for creating species (for now). In the future, if the tool is in demand or I get motivation, I plan to improve it.
I will be glad to any feedback, advice and simple explanations. You can also offer your ideas, which I will definitely consider.

P.S. At the moment I'm very bad at understanding modding, so I'll be glad for any useful materials/advice
P.P.S. This is a very early version, 100% contains bugs and shortcomings

## How to use

1. Fill species name
2. Fill group name
3. Choose an archetype
4. Fill leader min/max age (This parameter is responsible for determining from what age leaders will be offered to you)
5. Go to the tab: "Portrait models"
6. Drag Drag and drop pictures in .dds format
7. Return to previous tab
8. Click "CREATE"
9. Create a mod in the Stellaris launcher.
10. Go to the SMCT folder and find your mod folder.
11. Drag all the files from it to the folder of the mod created from the launcher (it's located in the documents/Paradox Interective/Stellaris/mod)

Ready! The mod has been created and you can check its functionality!
